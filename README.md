# De-Bible
This is a collection of penetration testing commands/tools. If you do not know how to use then don't use :D.
Created this for easy references so that i can save 10 seconds of my life instead of googling like mad or on the event i forget how to use >.<.
Called it De-Bible because i kept referring it to as "De Bible".
